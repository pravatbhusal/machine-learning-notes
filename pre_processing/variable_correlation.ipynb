    "# Variable Correlation\n",
    "We can calculate if variables are highly or lowly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an independent variable is highly correlated to another independent variable, then we can use that independent variable to \"predict\" the other independent variable. Therefore, this causes redundancy in the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem because independent variables are supposed to be independent from each other, so high correlation would actually skew that independence when fitting to a machine learning model.\n",
    "- This implies lower correlated independent variables are much better for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, high independent variable correlation can cause overfitting onto a model.\n",
    "- Fortunately, SKLearn models automatically remove highly correlated variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculate Correlation Coefficients\n",
    "In order to determine how correlated variables are to each other, we can calculate their correlation coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation Coefficients Range From -1 to 1:  \n",
    "1. If two variables have a negative coeff, then they're negatively correlated.\n",
    "    - If two variables have a coeff of -1, the they're perfectly negative multi-collinear.  \n",
    "2. If two variables have a positive coeff, then they're positively correlated.\n",
    "    - If two variables have a coeff of 1, then they're perfectly positive multi-collinear.  \n",
    "3. If two variables have a coeff of 0, then they have no linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a correlation matrix to help us observe the correlation between variables."
