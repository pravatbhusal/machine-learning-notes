# Clusteingr Models
Use clustering analysis to cluster similarly related data points without a dependent variable.
- Similar to classification, but there is no dependent variable to categorize the data points

Clustering only uses the features (independent variables) of a data point, and clusters the data point to other data points that are similar in features.

# Model Selection
- K-Means Clustering
    - When you want a simple, fast, efficient, and performant algorithm on any size data set
- Hierarchial Clustering
    - When you want to visualize the clustering process using a dendogram
